\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We have evaluated different similarity metrics to determine the fidelity of proxy applications with respect to their corresponding parent applications.
%
We show that most proxies are faithful representations of their parents, with minor divergences, independent of the similarity metric used.  Thus, we demonstrate that efficient, low-overhead metrics such as cosine similarity are sufficient for proxy evaluation.
%
We propose a feature selection framework called \us to find the most representative features, which efficiently shows the critical features in evaluating the similarity for proxy and parent pairs while greatly decreasing the data collection overhead. 
%
We demonstrate that the selected concise feature set captures the similarities across applications.
%
As well, we show some features that identify the dissimilarity between proxy and parents pairs, which would help the proxy co-design in the long run.
%
Similarity measurement and feature selection approaches in \us can also be applied to various HPC problems, such as compiler optimization, code refactoring, and application input sensitivity.
